# Standardized Argument Names


**Dot usage**: If there is a possibility of argument name conflicts between the function and any arguments passed down through `...`, it is strongly suggested that the argument names be prefixed with a dot (e.g. `.data`, `.x`, etc.)


## Data Arguments

 * `na_rm`: missing data handling. 

 * `new_data`: data to be predicted.

 * `weights`: case weights.

 * For `.data.frame` methods:

    * `x`: predictors or generic data objects. 
 
    * `y`: outcome data.
 
 * For `.formula` methods:
 
    * `formula`: a `y ~ x` formula specifying the outcome and predictors.
    
    * `data`: the data.frame to pull formula variables from.

## Numerical Arguments

 * `times`: the number of bootstraps, simulations, or other replications.
 
## Statistical Quantities 

 * `direction`: the type of hypothesis test alternative. 
 
 * `level`: interval levels (e.g., confidence, credible, prediction, and so on).

 * `link`: link functions for generalized linear models. 
 

## Tuning Parameters

* `activation`: the type of activation function between network layers. 

* `cost`: a cost value for SVM models. 
  
* `Cp`: The cost-complexity parameter in classical CART models. 

* `deg_free`: a parameter for the degrees of freedom. 

* `degree`: the polynomial degree. 
 
* `dropout`: the parameter dropout rate. 
 
* `epochs`: the number of iterations of training. 
 
* `hidden_units`: the number of hidden units in a network layer. 

* `Laplace`: the Laplace correction used to smooth low-frequency counts. 

* `learn_rate`: the rate at which the boosting algorithm adapts from iteration-to-iteration. 
   
* `loss_reduction`:  The reduction in the loss function required to split further. 

* `min_n`: The minimum number of data points in a node that are required for the node to be split further. 
 
* `mixture`: the proportion of L1 regularization in the model. 
 
* `mtry`: The number of predictors that will be randomly sampled at each split when creating the tree models.

* `neighbors`: a parameter for the number of neighbors used in a prototype model. 

* `num_comp`: the number of components in a model (e.g. PCA or PLS components).
 
* `num_terms`: a nonspecific parameter for the number of terms in a model. This can be used with models that include feature selection, such as MARS. 
  
* `prod_degree`: the number of terms to combine into interactions. A value of 1 implies an additive model. Useful for MARS models and some linear models.
    
* `prune`: a logical for whether a tree or set of rules should be pruned. 

* `rbf_sigma`: the sigma parameters of a radial basis function. 

* `penalty`: The amount of regularization used. In cases where different penalty types require to be differentiated, the names `L1` and `L2` are recommended.
   
* `sample_size`: the size of the data set used for modeling within an iteration of the modeling algorithm, such as stochastic gradient boosting.

* `surv_dist`: the statistical distribution of the data in a survival analysis model.
  
* `tree_depth`: The maximum depth of the tree (i.e. number of splits).
   
* `trees`: The number of trees contained in a random forest or boosted  ensemble. In the latter case, this is equal to the number of boosting iterations.  
  
* `weight_func`: The type of kernel function that weights the distances between samples (e.g. in a K-nearest neighbors model).
