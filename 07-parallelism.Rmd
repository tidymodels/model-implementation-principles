# Parallel Processing

<div id="par-long-back"></div> 

 * If a model function is not thread-safe, the documentation should clearly state that it cannot be run in parallel. 

 * Parallel processing should always be implemented on the _longest running_ operation. [{note}](#par-long) 

 * Parallel processing must be explictly requested by the user. 

 * Provide an argument to specify the amount (e.g. number of cores if appropriate) and default the function to run sequentially. 

<div id="par-seed-back"></div> 

 * Computations should be easily reproducible, even when run in parallel. Parallelism should not be an excuse for irreproducibility.  [{note}](#par-seed)
 
 * Computational code in other languages (e.g. Cpp, etc.) should pull from R's random number streams so that setting the seed prior to invoking these routines ensures reproducibility.
