# Print and Summary Methods

* Every class should have a `print` method that gives a concise description of the object. 

    * The `print` method should invisibly return the original object. 
    
    * The number of significant digits should be an option and should use the global default. 
    
    * Printing the call is discouraged.  

* `summary` methods are helpful but not required. These should create more verbose descriptions of the object. The `print` method for the `summary` object should follow the bullet-pointed remarks above for printing.
